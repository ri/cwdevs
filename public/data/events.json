Ruby is for you. Come learn with other beginners in our 4 2hr classes and start making your ideas a reality.</p> <p>Ruby borrows from many of the best programming languages out there, from smalltalk and Java, to Perl and Python... Which is why this particular open sourced program is one of the most suited to beginning programmers, it incorporates a little of everything while still offering a solid programming language that even organizations like NASA, 37Signals, and Twitter use.</p> <p> </p> <p>We will be sending out instructions to the students on how to setup a ruby development environment on OS X and Windows before the first class. In the first class, we will learn to use this dev environment to create a ruby application.</p> <p> </p> <p>Class 1: April 1st 6:30-8:30pm</p> <p>Class 2: April 8th 6:30-8:30pm</p> <p>Class 3: April 15th 6:30 - 8:30pm</p> <p>Class 4: April 22nd 6:30 - 8:30pm</p> <p> </p> <p><em>\"Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines.

It is one of the first developed server-side scripting languages to be embedded into an HTML source document rather than calling an external file to process data. The code is interpreted by a Web server with a PHP processor module which generates the resulting Web page. It has also evolved to include a command-line interface capability and can be used in standalone graphical applications.</p> <p>PHP can be deployed on most Web servers and also as a standalone shell on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge. PHP is installed on more than 20 million Web sites and 1 million Web servers. Notable software that uses PHP includes Drupal, Joomla, MediaWiki, and WordPress.</p> <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <em>Some HTML and CSS.

Slideshows, advertising pop-ups and <a href=\"http://mashable.com/category/google/\">Google's</a> autocomplete feature are all examples of JavaScript at work. It was first created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 — nicknamed Mocha during development, released in beta as LiveScript and ultimately named JavaScript in order to piggyback on the popularity of Java (another programming language) for marketing reasons.</p> <p>At first, developers didn't take JavaScript seriously, because it wasn't seen as a serious development language like Java, Ruby or Python, which are server-side languages. JavaScript was the frosting on the cake, only responsible for user experience. But the language continues to become more prolific, often recommended as a first language to learn for beginners. If you use JavaScript with a framework called <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2011/03/09/node-js/\">Node.js</a>, you can now actually use JavaScript as a server-side language.</p> <p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">Prerequisites:</span></strong> <em>Some HTML</em></p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration : underline\"><strong>Materials:</strong></span> <em>Your Own Laptop</em></p> <p> </p> <p>Class dates are as scheduled:</p> <p><br>   Class 1 - May 6th - 6:30 - 8:30pm</p> <p>Class 2 - May 13th - 6:30 - 8:30pm</p> <p>Class 3 - May 20th - 6:30 - 8:30pm</p> <p>Class 4 - May 27th - 6:30 - 8:30pm</p> <p> </p> <p>Please note the refund policy: Your payment of $80 guarantees your seat in the entire course.
